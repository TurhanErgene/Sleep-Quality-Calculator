## üìù Project Overview

This project is a simple IoT-based sleep quality monitor that uses a Raspberry Pi Pico WH to read environmental data such as temperature, humidity, and light. These values are used to determine how suitable the room is for sleep. The system lights up different LEDs (green, yellow, red) based on the sleep quality score, and the data is visualized on an Adafruit IO dashboard.

**Estimated Time to Complete:** ~4‚Äì6 hours, depending on experience with MicroPython and wiring.

## üéØ Objective

I chose to build this project because sleep is essential ‚Äîespecially for those with very sensitive sleep‚Äî and is often impacted by subtle environmental factors. This system helps identify patterns and provides feedback to improve the sleep environment.

- **Why this project:** Combines multiple sensor types with real-time evaluation logic.
- **Purpose:** To measure and score room conditions for sleep readiness.
- **Expected Insights:** Whether your room is too hot, humid, or bright for optimal sleep. Also helps build awareness over time via a dashboard.

## üíª Computer Setup

- **PC:** Windows 11
- **IDE Used:** Thonny (Python IDE with MicroPython support)
- **Steps:**
  1. Install Thonny and select MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico) as the interpreter.
  2. Connect Raspberry Pi Pico WH via USB.
  3. Flash MicroPython firmware if not already installed.
  4. Upload code using Thonny‚Äôs file browser.
  5. Use Thonny's terminal to monitor outputs.

## üîå Circuit Assembly

### üñçÔ∏è Circuit Diagram

![Circuit Diagram](./SleepQualityMeter.jpg)

- **DHT11** connected to GPIO 15 (Data), 3.3V and GND.
- **LM35** connected to ADC pin 27.
- **LDR** connected to ADC pin 26 in a voltage divider.
- **LEDs** connected to GPIO 16 (Green), 17 (Yellow), and 18 (Red).
- **Resistors:** 330Œ© for LEDs, 4.7 kŒ© for LDR voltage divider.

### Electrical Considerations
- Voltage levels kept at 3.3V to avoid damaging the Pico WH pins.
- 330Œ© resistor on LEDs ensures current does not exceed safe limits (~10 mA).
- Voltage divider for LDR protects ADC pin and translates resistance changes to voltage variations.


üìå *Use caution with voltage levels.*

## üåê Platform

The project currently runs locally on the Raspberry Pi Pico WH and sends the data regarding the quality parameter to Adafruit IO.

- **Data points:** Temperature (¬∞C), Humidity (%), Light (%), Sleep Quality (text).
- **Visualization:** Line graphs for sensor values + colored indicator for sleep score.
- **Frequency:** Data is sent every few seconds for live monitoring. Beware that it's not every second due to rate limit of Adafruit.
---

## Transmitting the Data / Connectivity
- Sensor data is transmitted to Adafruit IO every few seconds to comply with the platform‚Äôs API rate limits and ensure stable data flow without interruptions.
- Communication uses the **MQTT protocol over TLS**, leveraging key values stored securely in a separate `keys.py` file to authenticate with Adafruit IO.
- The device connects to the network via **Wi-Fi**, utilizing the Raspberry Pi Pico WH‚Äôs built-in wireless module for convenient and reliable indoor connectivity.
- Data transmission occurs securely through **MQTT with TLS encryption**, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of the data in transit.
- **Design rationale:** Wi-Fi was selected for its widespread availability in typical home environments and sufficient range to cover a bedroom. The security benefits of MQTT over TLS protect the data.
- **Trade-offs considered:** While Wi-Fi offers reliable and high-bandwidth communication, it consumes more power compared to low-energy alternatives such as LoRa or Zigbee. However, given the project‚Äôs focus on a stationary, mains-powered device within a home setting, the convenience and simplicity of Wi-Fi integration outweighed the increased power consumption.
- **Security measures:** API keys are stored locally on the device in a protected configuration file. No sensitive personal or user-identifiable information is transmitted, minimizing privacy risks.

## Reflections and Future Improvements
- Adding motion or sound sensors could enhance sleep quality insights.
- More advanced sensor calibration (DHT22 instead of DHT11) for higher accuracy.
- Packaging the device into a small enclosure for bedroom use.
- Exploring low-power communication options for battery operation could be fun to implement too. Which would require better understanding of LoRaWAN protocol that includes Class A, B and C.
